# Py-Me-Up-Charlie

This repository was created for the DU Data Analytics Bootcamp homework.

I created two scripts in python for this challenge.

PyBank

This script reads in a csv file that contains profit and loss data by month for a company. It analyzes and outputs the profit/loss data and outputs the total number of months in the dataset, net total profits/losses, average profit/loss over given time period, and calls out the best and worst performing months for the company over the given time period.
This analysis is both printed to the terminanl and exported to a txt file.

PyPoll

This script takes election results from a csv file and reads it into python.  It analyzes the data to return the total number of votes, list of candidates, percentage and total number of votes each candidate won, and of course the winner of the election. 
The analysis output can be viewed via the terminal or a txt file that is exported at the end of the script.
